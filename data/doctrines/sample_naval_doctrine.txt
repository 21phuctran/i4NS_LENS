NAVAL DOCTRINE - SAMPLE TRAINING MANUAL
========================================

CHAPTER 1: SPEED CHANGES
------------------------

1.1 Standard Operating Procedures for Speed Changes

When changing speed during operations:
- All speed changes must be logged with timestamp and tracking number
- Changes exceeding 5 knots must be communicated to all stations
- Speed reductions for man overboard drills must follow emergency protocols:
  * Reduce speed to 5 knots immediately
  * Maintain heading until search pattern initiated
  * Log all actions with timestamps

1.2 Speed Change Documentation

Required documentation for speed changes:
- Timestamp of change (UTC)
- Previous speed
- New speed
- Reason for change
- Tracking number for reference


CHAPTER 2: COURSE CHANGES
--------------------------

2.1 Course Change Protocols

When changing course:
- Log timestamp, previous course, new course
- Assign tracking number to maneuver
- Notify navigation team of all course changes > 10 degrees
- For training exercises, document reasoning for tactical review


CHAPTER 3: CONTACT DETECTION AND TRACKING
------------------------------------------

3.1 Surface Contact Detection

Upon detecting surface contact:
- Immediately assign tracking number
- Log bearing, range, and timestamp
- Classify contact type (merchant, military, unknown)
- Maintain continuous tracking until contact passes
- Document all detection events for post-mission analysis

3.2 Contact Classification Requirements

All contacts must be classified according to:
- Visual identification when possible
- Radar signature analysis
- AIS data (when available)
- Behavior patterns

Contact classification must be documented with:
- Tracking number
- Timestamp of detection
- Initial classification
- Confidence level


CHAPTER 4: MAN OVERBOARD PROCEDURES
------------------------------------

4.1 Immediate Actions

Upon man overboard:
- Sound alarm immediately
- Reduce speed to 5 knots
- Mark position with GPS timestamp
- Deploy recovery equipment
- Initiate search pattern

All man overboard drills and actual events must be logged with:
- Exact timestamp
- Position (latitude/longitude)
- Sea conditions
- Recovery time
- Lessons learned


CHAPTER 5: MISSION START AND END PROCEDURES
--------------------------------------------

5.1 Mission Commencement

At mission start:
- Log start time (UTC)
- Record initial position
- Document mission objectives
- Verify all systems operational
- Begin mission log with tracking number

5.2 Mission Completion

At mission end:
- Log completion time
- Record final position
- Document mission outcomes
- Prepare post-mission debrief
- Submit mission log for review


CHAPTER 6: POST-MISSION DEBRIEFING
-----------------------------------

6.1 Debrief Requirements

All missions require post-mission debrief covering:
- Timeline of significant events
- Comparison of planned vs actual actions
- Doctrine compliance review
- Lessons learned
- Recommendations for future operations

6.2 Lessons Learned Documentation

Document lessons learned including:
- What worked well
- What could be improved
- Doctrinal gaps identified
- Training recommendations
- Equipment performance issues
